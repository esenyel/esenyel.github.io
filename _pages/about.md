I am an assistant professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) [Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering (ECSE) department](https://ecse.rpi.edu/ "ECSE") since January 2024. Before, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the [Aeronautics and Astronautics Department](https://aa.stanford.edu/ "Aero&Astro") at Stanford University, working with Prof. [Mykel Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/ "Mykel Kochenderfer") at [Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/sisl/cgi-bin/wordpress/ "SISL") (SISL) and [Stanford Center for AI Safety](https://aisafety.stanford.edu/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia, where I was part of [Autonomous Mobile Robots Lab](https://www.bezzorobotics.com/, "Autonomous Mobile Robots Lab") and [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab, "Link Lab") under the supervision of Prof. Nicola Bezzo. I received my MS and BS degrees from the [Department of  Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bogazici University, Istanbul](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/, "Bogazici EE") in 2016 and 2014 respectively. 

At RPI, I am the director of the Reliable Intelligent Systems Laboratory (RISL). If you're interested in learning more about this lab, please take a look at the [Research](https://esenyel.github.io//research/ "Research") page. 

My research focuses on developing techniques to improve the **safety** of autonomous systems operating under uncertainty. I leverage **reachability analysis** tools, **machine learning**, and **runtime monitoring and recovery** techniques to provide safe decisions and to adapt to unforeseen conditions.

I enjoy hiking, ultimate frisbee, yoga, collecting vintage photographs, and  traveling.
