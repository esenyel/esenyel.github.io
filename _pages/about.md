I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Aeronautics and Astronautics Department](https://aa.stanford.edu/ "Aero&Astro") at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Mykel Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/ "Mykel Kochenderfer") in the [Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/sisl/cgi-bin/wordpress/ "SISL") (SISL). I receieved my Ph.D. degree in Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia, where I was part of [Autonomous Mobile Robots Lab](https://www.bezzorobotics.com/, "Autonomous Mobile Robots Lab") and [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab, "Link Lab") under the supervision of Prof. Nicola Bezzo. I obtained my MS and BS degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bogazici University, Istanbul in 2016 and 2014 respectively. 

My research focuses on developing techniques to improve the **safety** of autonomous systems operating under uncertainties. I leverage **reachability analysis** tools, **machine learning** and **runtime monitoring and recovery** techniques to provide safe decisions while adapting to the unforeseen changes.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, yoga, collecting vintage photographs, watching independent movies, and  traveling.
